STATUS UPDATE LOGS:

August 2nd, 2021: Here is a link to the Spotify playlist showing the results from my project looking for song recommendations based on the content of the song "Necksweat": https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6t0YoR2PLLw4sN702fpnV1?si=0f0628f974bb4e05

Mar 25th, 2021: Initial upload and commit of notebook and misc files.  The state of the recommender is manual within the notebooks. A web app is planned for the coming weeks with GUI interface that will show hyperlinked thumbnails.  A similarity measure of audio features will be listed with reach recommendation to show why the song was recommended.  The ability to toggle features on and off will also be added.
